## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to **Character Crisis**! This program allows you to create ASCII art for an input text string, using a given charmap. The program also stores the text as an image.

> [!NOTE]
> The logo for the program was created using the program itself.

## üé® Features

- **Dynamic loading of charmaps**: The program can load any charmap from a file, allowing for custom charmaps, of different row sizes.
- **Efficient storing of charmaps**: The program has 4 columns per row, so that each character can be represented by 1 hex digit for it's ASCII art charmap character.
- **Storing text images**: The program displays the ASCII art in the terminal, but also stores a BMP image of the text in the ASCII art font.

## üì¶ TODO

- [ ] Use different base number system like base64 instead of hex (base 16) to store more columns per row because 4 is asymmetric and not very efficient.
	- 5 columns per row would look nice and symmetric. 5x5 is also square (the 4x4 does not look good because it has so few grid cells).
- [ ] Add functionality for escape characters such as `\t` and `\n`.
- [ ] Add more characters to the charmaps (rather than A-Z, make it !-~).
- [ ] Add charmaps and functionality for segment displays (7 segment, 14 segment, etc.).
